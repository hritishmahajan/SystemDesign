# ðŸŽ¥ System Design for Beginners â€” Piyush Garg
This is the link to the Design - https://app.eraser.io/workspace/iqJpubqh27BKsgnPWQud

## ðŸ§  Overview
Introductory session on understanding how large-scale systems are built, scaled, and maintained.  
Covers fundamentals like load balancing, proxies, scaling, and system design flow.

## ðŸ”¹ What is System Design?
System design = Designing scalable, reliable, maintainable, and efficient software architecture.

**Key Goals:**
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Maintainability
- Efficiency

## ðŸ”¹ Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Key Notes |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Client | End user making a request | Web / mobile app |
| API Gateway / Reverse Proxy | Entry point | Handles routing, auth |
| Load Balancer | Distributes load | Prevents overload |
| Application Servers | Run core logic | Keep stateless |
| Database | Persistent data store | SQL or NoSQL |
| Cache | Faster access | Redis / Memcached |
| CDN | Serve static content | Global latency reduction |
| Message Queue | Async processing | Kafka / RabbitMQ |
| Monitoring | Health tracking | Prometheus / Grafana |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Scaling

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Vertical | Increase machine power | Add RAM/CPU |
| Horizontal | Add more servers | Multiple instances |
| Auto Scaling | Dynamic scaling | Cloud auto tools |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Architectural Styles

**Monolithic:** Single deployable unit â†’ simple but hard to scale  
**Microservices:** Modular units â†’ scalable, independent, needs coordination

---

## ðŸ”¹ System Design Process

1. Clarify requirements  
2. Estimate scale  
3. Define APIs  
4. Design data flow  
5. Choose storage (SQL/NoSQL)  
6. Add caching/load balancing  
7. Ensure fault tolerance  
8. Discuss trade-offs

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts

- **Stateless servers**
- **Replication**
- **Sharding**
- **Caching strategies**
- **Load balancing algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections)**
- **CDN usage**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example: Video Streaming Platform

- Requests â†’ Load balancer â†’ App servers  
- Thumbnails/videos via CDN  
- Metadata in DB  
- Frequently accessed info cached  
- Logging and monitoring enabled  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

âœ… Stateless servers  
âœ… Use caching  
âœ… Implement monitoring  
âœ… Prepare for failures  
âœ… Design for scale  
âœ… Document assumptions  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Takeaways

- Focus on concepts  
- Understand interactions  
- Justify design choices  
- Prioritize availability + scalability  
- Know your trade-offs
